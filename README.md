# Hevy2Strava

A simple python script that uploads old Hevy workouts from the "workout_data.csv" file obtained from the export within the app.

For new workouts it's possible to enable the Strava Integration in the Hevy App settings. The script is written to mimic the Strava Integration, with the only missing detail being the picture.
